## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

**Problem**: No emails being received

**Solutions**:

1. Check backend console for error logs
2. Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS in .env
3. Ensure you're using App Password, not regular password
4. Restart backend server after .env changes
5. Check Gmail "Sent" folder to confirm emails were sent
6. Check recipient's spam/junk folder

### "Authentication Failed" Error

**Problem**: Error in console about authentication

**Solutions**:

1. Verify 2-Step Verification is enabled on Gmail
2. Generate a new App Password
3. Ensure no extra spaces in EMAIL_PASS
4. Use the exact 16-character App Password (with spaces is OK)

### Emails Going to Spam

**Problem**: Emails arrive but in spam folder

**Solutions**:

1. Mark as "Not Spam" in recipient email
2. Add sender to contacts
3. For production: Use dedicated email service (SendGrid, etc.)
4. Configure SPF/DKIM records for custom domain

## 📊 Email Metrics & Monitoring

### Console Logging:

All email attempts are logged to backend console:

```
✅ Reset email sent: <message-id>
✅ Notification email sent to manager: manager@example.com
✅ Approval email sent to: employee@example.com
✅ Welcome email sent to: newuser@example.com
❌ Failed to send email: <error message>
```

### Monitoring Recommendations:

- Monitor backend logs for email failures
- Track email delivery rates
- Set up alerts for repeated failures
- Review user feedback about email content
